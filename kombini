# access config files directly from dmenu
# observe the appslist and spells file for reference and create/edit your files accordingly
# if you put create more files make sure to add them in #choices variable
# if invoke with argument it outputs desired file or invoked without arguments shows dmenu list.
# I know comments are bloat so remove them if you wish.
